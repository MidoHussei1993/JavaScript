# There’s a “root” object called window . It has two roles:

> 1. First, it is a global object for JavaScript code, as described in the chapter
> Global object.
> 2. Second, it represents the “browser window” and provides methods to control it.

function sayHi() {
alert("Hello");
}
// global functions are accessible as properties of window
window.sayHi();

========
# DOM (Document Object Model) :
> The document object gives access to the page content. We can change or
> create anything on the page using it.

========
# BOM (Browser object model) :

> Browser Object Model (BOM) are additional objects provided by the browser (host
> environment) to work with everything except the document.

=============
# DOM tree :
> The backbone of an HTML document are tags.
> According to Document Object Model (DOM), every HTML-tag is an object.
> Nested tags are called “children” of the enclosing one.
> The text inside a tag it is an object as well.
> All these objects are accessible using JavaScript.


===================
There are 12 node types  . In practice we usually work with 4 of them:
1. document – the “entry point” into DOM.
2. element nodes – HTML-tags, the tree building blocks.
3. text nodes – contain text.
4. comments – sometimes we can put the information there, it won’t be shown,
but JS can read it from the DOM.
================
Children: childNodes, firstChild, lastChild
